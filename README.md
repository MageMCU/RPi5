# Uno (Atmega328PU) - Raspberry Pi 5 and older models for communication

## Raspberry Pi 5 as a computer
- I used Samsung SSD for fast processing with the Raspberry Pi 5 for testing circuits and code connected by USB to the Uno (atmega328PU) while debugging with a serial monitor.

## Testing Platform
- The MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.
- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 
- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.
